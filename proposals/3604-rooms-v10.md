# MSC3604: Room Version 10

A new room version, `10`, is proposed using [room version 9](TBD) as a base
and incorporating the following MSCs:

* [MSC2176](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2176) - Update to redaction rules

**TODO: Remove MSCs with no likelihood from below**

* [MSC3667](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3667) - Enforcing integer parsing on power levels
* [MSC2244](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244) - Mass redactions
* [MSC2174](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2174) - Move `redacts` to sane place
* [MSC2175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2175) - Remove extraneous `creator` field
* [MSC2828](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2828) - Restrict allowed user IDs over federation
* [MSC1229](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1229) - Mitigating abuse of `depth`

Though other MSCs are capable of being included in this version, they do not have sufficient implementation to be
considered stable enough for v10 rooms. A future room version may still include them.

Room version 10 upon being added to the specification shall be considered stable. No other room versions are affected
by this MSC.

## Unstable prefix

Implementation is strongly not suggested at this stage.

Prefixes in the wild:
* `org.matrix.msc3604.opt1`: `v9` + MSC2176 (https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11662)
